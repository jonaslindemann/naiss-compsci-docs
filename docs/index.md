Welcome to the NAISS Development best-practice guides! This comprehensive documentation provides best practices, tutorials, and reference materials for software development on NAISS HPC systems.

## Overview

These guides are designed to help researchers and developers effectively utilize NAISS (National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden) high-performance computing resources. Whether you're compiling code, managing dependencies, or optimizing performance, you'll find practical guidance here.

## What You'll Find

- **[Modules](modules/index.md)**: Learn to manage software environments using the module system
- **[Compilers](compilers/prgenv.md)**: Configure compiler environments and optimize your code
- **[Build Systems](build-systems/cmake.md)**: Set up and troubleshoot build systems like CMake
- **[Python](python/environments.md)**: Create isolated Python environments and optimize performance
- **[Containers](containers/apptainer.md)**: Use Apptainer for containerized applications
- **[Profiling & Debugging](profiling-debugging/debugging.md)**: Debug and profile your applications
- **[Portability](portability/naiss-systems.md)**: Write portable code across NAISS systems

## Getting Started

If you're new to NAISS HPC systems, we recommend starting with:

1. The [Modules Overview](modules/index.md) to understand environment management
2. The [Compiler Environments](compilers/prgenv.md) guide to set up your development environment
3. System-specific information in the [Portability section](portability/naiss-systems.md)

## Contributing

These guides are continuously updated to reflect best practices and new developments. If you have suggestions or corrections, please contribute back to the community.
